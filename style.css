/*Question 3
In your own words, explain how the script for moving the carousel works.
Answer:
The carousel is basically used to aid in the transition of content dispalyed in a website/page/application.
It contains a series of content, that is images, videos, or texts dispaled in the form of a slideshow and can also
include indicators for the previous and next pages.
It is mostly created using CSS and a bit of JavaScript. It normally doesn't transition form one content to the next 
when the webpage is inactive. One uses JavaScript to give it a transition {setTimeout} of however long they'd like
the content to be dispalyed.


/*Question 4
What will the code below output to the console and why?
The code will have four outputs;
     The first outer function will output Lovelace, this is because in JavaScript, 'this' is not a variable,
     it is a special keyword.
     The second output from the outer function will also be Lovelace, this is because closure is used here, and
     in JavaScript, closures have access to the variables of the enclosing function through the scope.
     The third output will be an empty string because there is no variable for the 'this' keyword to access any 
     properties from.
     The final output will be Lovelace because there is lexical scoping, where the  the inner function has 
     access to the variables of the parent scope
